        <p>When DPS Indirapuram started in 2003, little did anyone know that one day its baby-steps would transform into giant leaps of success and glory!
                Yes, this was definitely a result of a vision well-conceived by the School Management headed by the school Pro-ViceChairperson Mrs. Santosh Bansal; a vision that was very soon transformed into reality by the grit and determination of the Founder Principal Mrs. Meeta Rai, her team and the school staff! Their labour of love is the reason why today the school is recognized for its excellence in all spheres, be it scholastic or co-scholastic!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Inheriting this legacy of commitment and dedicated service to the cause of education, the school stands committed to nurturing generations of children as sensitive, compassionate and responsible global citizens who will surge ahead to explore newer vistas!</p>
